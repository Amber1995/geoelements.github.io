### Status updates
As a group, we meet on MWF at 10 AM to update everyone about the status of the project. This is a short two-minutes talk (no presentations) about your research. The update should cover: 
- What you have been working on the last 2 days, 
- What is blocked, and 
- What is your plan for the next two days.

 This quick status updates allows us to identify any potentially blocking aspect of your research sooner and we can have a deep-dive meeting to resolve issues. 

### Deep-dive Meetings
We’ll have at least one deep-dive meeting every two weeks and should be booked online [https://calendly.com/krishnakut/30min](https://calendly.com/krishnakut/30min). These deep-dive meetings can be as frequent, if you feel stuck or at least once every two weeks. All meetings should have an agenda and a Google doc describing the updates, questions on Asana Meeting Agenda. Please make sure the documents are available at least two hours before the meeting. Please create an agenda with the following outline:

- How may I help you?

- To discuss

- Updates

- Next steps

- Goals

### Brain Trust Meetings
We’ll have weekly [Brain Trust meetings](https://kks32.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CBGEO/pages/970326021/Brain+Trust+meetings) to discuss research challenges and collectively find new research insights and troubleshoot problems. 

### Research Updates
Make sure your project on Asana is upto date. All in-progress tasks should have deadlines and an associated duration of when you expect to finish the task. Keep tasks short (<6 hours). Ensure you keep the tasks active and include a document explaining your findings/review/results in a good when you move your task for review. 

### Mentor-Mentee 360
This is to have a feedback loop between you and me (mentee and mentor). A Mentor-Mentee 360 happens every 3 months on the first week of the month. A document should be available private to you in your google drive. We’ll cover the following topics:

- What amazing work you have done?

- What areas do you think you should improve?

- What are your goals for this quarter?

- How can your mentor help you?

- What skill would you like to develop/career advice?
