### 1-1 Meetings
We’ll have at least 1 weekly 1-1 meeting. All meetings should have an agenda and a Google doc describing the updates, questions on either Asana or Discourse. Please create an agenda with the following outline:

- How may I help you?

- To discuss

- Updates

- Next steps

- Goals

### Brain Trust Meetings
We’ll have weekly [Brain Trust meetings](https://kks32.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CBGEO/pages/970326021/Brain+Trust+meetings) to discuss research challenges and collectively find new research insights and troubleshoot problems. 

### Research Updates
#### Daily updates
At 5 PM (or the end of the day) every weekday, please post an update to our slack channel #updates on the work you have been doing that day.

#### Weekly goals
Every Monday at 8 AM (or at the start of your day), please post your goals for the week on our slack channel #updates.

#### Weekly updates on Asana
Every Friday at 5 PM (or at the end of your day), please post your progress for the week on the Asana Progress tab. The status updates are useful to see if a project is on track or falling behind. 

#### Research Roadmap
This is a monthly planner. The roadmap gives an overview of what you would like to do this month (goals).  For example, I want to finish a proposal this month. I will only add major goals for the week. (Please don't add minor tasks like a review, unless that's your goal for the week). The goal is a major outcome, not a task. Hopefully, this will help us plan for a month and see how we are doing.

RoadMaps are available on Asana with individual sections for each one of us: [https://app.asana.com/0/1170988028189084/timeline](https://app.asana.com/0/1170988028189084/timeline)

#### Milestones
Every project should have milestones. These are manageable task units that can be finished in 2 weeks to a month at most. Milestones should be set in the Asana project tab.

### Mentor-Mentee meetings
This is to have a feedback loop between you and me (mentee and mentor). A Mentor-Mentee meeting every 3 months on the first Monday of the month. A document should be available private to you in your google drive. We’ll cover the following topics:

- What amazing work you have done?

- What areas do you think you should improve?

- What are your goals for this quarter?

- How can your mentor help you?

- What skill would you like to develop/career advice?
